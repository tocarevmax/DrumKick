DrumKick is a full-stack project purposed to redesign popular SongKick but as a React/Redux single-page application.
It uses Ruby on Rails on the backend to serve RESTful JSON API endpoints.


## Features

* User authentication and session management.

* Richly seeded database with nearly 1,000 most-searched artists and accurate information on thousands of upcoming concerts for them.
